# Overview

Game Description/Purpose

I wanted to give myself a challenge with this project, but wanted to do something that I found interesting. Games have always interested
me and I decided to dust off the python to use as the language. I ended up using the arcade library to make the process easier. I decided
to do a classic snake game with a few twists to strech my skills. I added a difficulty modifier that will make the snake move faster or slower
depending on the selection. I also decided to add seperate music for both the menu and the game windows. The game takes input from the arrow
keys to control the direction that the snake is moving. If the snake runs into itself or the border, the game will be ended and you will have 
to restart. You turn the snake to collect blocks that randomly spawn on the screen. Collecting blocks will increase the players score and add 
to the snake's tail. Snake is a game that I have had experience playing since I was little. I remember playing it as a little kid in school
when in the computer lab. It was really fun to be able to create my own and add some twists to such a classic game.

# Development Environment

One of the tools that helped me while creating this program, was google's snake game. It was helpful to see the product of a working snake 
program in the sense that it helped me to visualize how the code should work. I also used a site called pixabay (see URL below) to find
free to use music for the game.

Language: Python
Libraries: Arcade, OS, Random
