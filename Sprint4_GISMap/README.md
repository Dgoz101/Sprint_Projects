# Overview

When I was deciding what to do for my next project, I though of GIS mapping and how that could help people around me with a real world application. A lot of students around me have a hard time finding housing with the right price tag attached to it that also has parking spaces for their vehicle. I decided to create a map that shows apartment complexes as pins on a map. When you click on the pin, it displays the name, price,parking information, and phone number for the apartment complex. I used ArcGIS to help me with this project and wrote in HTML and javascript to create the site itself. This was a fun project to complete and there is so much more that I can do with GIS mapping now that I understand the basics. Hopefully I can fully implement this one day so that students can use it to find an apartment that is close to campus and has a price within their budget.
